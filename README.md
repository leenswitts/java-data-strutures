# Data Strutures In Java
   A data structure is a particular way of organizing or arranging data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
   
## Algorithms
   An algorithm is a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.
    t is a mmethod rather than the computer program itself. it specifies the steps we can use to solve that problem.
    
### 1. Java Arrays
   an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location. / An array is a container object that holds 
   a fixed number of values of a single type.
   The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements.
   We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array
   Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.

   `Following are some important points about Java arrays.`
   * The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0.
   * In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated
   * A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
   * The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not long or short.
